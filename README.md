# Solidity Security Scenarios

## Overview
Welcome to the Solidity Security Scenarios repository! 
This repository is dedicated to providing examples of common security vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts, 
along with solutions and best practices to mitigate these issues. 
Our goal is to help developers understand and avoid security pitfalls when developing decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into directories, each representing a specific security scenario. Each scenario directory contains:
- A `README.md` file explaining the scenario, its potential impact, and the solution.
- Example Solidity contracts demonstrating the vulnerability and its solution.
- Solution contracts to fix and prevent the attack.

## Scenarios Covered
- **Reentrancy**: Understanding how reentrancy attacks work and how to prevent them.
- **Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow**: Identifying and mitigating arithmetic vulnerabilities.
- **Self Destruct**: Preventing accidental or malicious contract destruction.
- **Delegate Call**: Handling delegate call risks securely.
- **Source of Randomness**: Ensuring secure randomness in smart contracts.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Recognizing and preventing DoS attacks on smart contracts.
- **Phishing with tx.origin**: Avoiding tx.origin-based phishing attacks.
- **Hiding Malicious Code with External Contract**: Detecting and preventing hidden malicious code.
- **Honeypot**: Understanding and avoiding honeypot traps.
- **Bypass Contract Size Check**: Ensuring contract size checks cannot be bypassed.
- **Accessing Private Data**: Protecting private data in smart contracts.
- **Front Running**: Mitigating risks of front running in smart contracts.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/dappteacher/solidity-security-scenarios.git

2. **Navigate to a Scenario**:
   bash
   cd solidity-security-scenarios/scenarios/reentrancy
   
3. **Read the Documentation**:
   - Each scenario includes a `README.md` with a detailed explanation.
     
4. **Review and Run the Code**:
   - Examine the Solidity code to understand the vulnerability and its solution.
   - Use provided test scripts to simulate attacks and validate the fixes.
